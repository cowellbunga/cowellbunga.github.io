__Applying a predictive model to produce bathymetric data from topographic data__

## Problem
Bathymetric data is becoming more readily available for large bodies of water, especially in coastal areas. I have observed less availability of this data for small bodies of water (ex: lakes, ponds), especially those situated in forested areas. I would like to identify small, inland water bodies that lack high quality bathymetric data and then apply existing methods from [Martinsen et al. (2023)](https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lom3.10573) to fill the data gap. The products of the analysis will be used for 3D visualization and as inputs for future analyses, such as fishing condition forecasting and habitat modeling.

## Methods
* Review existing gaps in high resolution bathymetric data for inland water bodies in my local area

* Create a list of water bodies that lack high quality bathymetric data

* Collect 3DEP elevation data (~3 ft. resolution) for the selected water bodies

* Adapt elevation data as an input for the methodology presented in [the methods](https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lom3.10573) described above

* [__BONUS__]: If circumstances allow it, a bonus to this project will be the concurrent collection of LiDAR data for these water bodies to compare outputs when using higher resolution data (~3 cm.)

## Goals
* Produce (predicted) bathymetric data to fill the gaps identified in the review phase

* Apply the high-res bathymetric data to produce higher accuracy models for predicting fishing conditions under different weather scenarios at the various water bodies
