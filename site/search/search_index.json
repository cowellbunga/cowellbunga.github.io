I have observed less availability of this data for small bodies of water (ex: lakes, ponds), especially those situated in forested areas. I would like to identify small, inland water bodies that lack high quality bathymetric data and then apply existing methods from Martinsen et al. (2023) to fill the data gap. The products of the analysis will be used for 3D visualization and as inputs for future analyses, such as fishing condition forecasting and habitat modeling. Methods # Review existing gaps in high resolution bathymetric data for inland water bodies in my local area Create a list of water bodies that lack high quality bathymetric data Collect 3DEP elevation data (~3 ft. resolution) for the selected water bodies Adapt elevation data as an input for the methodology presented in the methods described above [ BONUS ]: If circumstances allow it, a bonus to this project will be the concurrent collection of LiDAR data for these water bodies to compare outputs when using higher resolution data (~3 cm.) Goals # Produce (predicted) bathymetric data to fill the gaps identified in the review phase Apply the high-res bathymetric data to produce higher accuracy models for predicting fishing conditions under different weather scenarios at the various water bodies","title":"Applying a predictive model to produce bathymetric data from topographic data"},{"location":"projects/active/bathy/#problem","text":"Bathymetric data is becoming more readily available for large bodies of water, especially in coastal areas.
