I have observed less availability of this data for small bodies of water (ex: lakes, ponds), especially those situated in forested areas. I would like to identify small, inland water bodies that lack high quality bathymetric data and then apply existing methods from Martinsen et al. (2023) to fill the data gap.

Methods # Review existing gaps in high resolution bathymetric data for inland water bodies in my local area Create a list of water bodies that lack high quality bathymetric data Collect 3DEP elevation data (~3 ft. resolution) for the selected water bodies Adapt elevation data as an input for the methodology presented in the methods described above [ BONUS ]: If circumstances allow it, a bonus to this project will be the concurrent collection of LiDAR data for these water bodies to compare outputs when using higher resolution data (~3 cm.)
